# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains small Python projects created to practise
core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions,
and basic file handling.

## Projects

### Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game where the program randomly selects
a number and the user tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

**Features:**
- Random number generation
- Unlimited attempts
- Feedback for each guess (too high / too low)
- Attempt counter

**File:** `number_guessing_game.py`

## Future Plans
- Add a high-score system saved to a file
- Track user history
- Add difficulty levels
- Improve game feedback and polish

---

### Pick a Door Game
A text-based game where the user must choose between **three doors**.
Behind **two doors** is a safe path, while **one door hides an Anomaly**.

To win, the player must choose the correct door **five times in a row**
and escape without encountering the Anomaly.

**Features:**
- Random door selection
- Input validation (only accepts 1, 2, or 3)
- Streak-based win condition
- Game-over on wrong choice
- Simple game logic using functions and loops

**File:** `pick_a_door.py`

## Future Plans
- Add more features such as: "a monster after the user"
- Add difficulty levels
- Improve game feedback and polish

More projects will be added progressively as part of my coding revision.
