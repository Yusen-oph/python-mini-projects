# Python Mini Projects

This repository contains small Python projects created to practise
core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions,
and basic file handling.

## Projects

### Number Guessing Game
A simple number guessing game where the program randomly selects
a number and the user tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

**Features:**
- Random number generation
- Unlimited attempts
- Feedback for each guess (too high / too low)
- Attempt counter

**File:** `number_guessing_game.py`

## Future Plans
- Add a high-score system saved to a file
- Track user history
- Add difficulty levels
- Improve input validation

More projects will be added progressively as part of my coding revision.
